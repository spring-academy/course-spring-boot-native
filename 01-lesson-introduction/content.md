## What Will You Learn?

This course is designed to introduce you to GraalVM native images: Java applications which are compiled to native code, and therefore don't require a JVM installation to run. You'll learn about:

- The advantages of native image deployment (namely, lower memory consumption compared to the JVM and instant startup).
- The tradeoffs between native image and standard JVM deployment.
- The extra development tasks that are needed to compile a Spring Boot application to a native image.

You'll also "learn by doing", in our hands-on, interactive labs.

## Hands-On Labs

The Labs in this course provide an interactive terminal and editor, so you donâ€™t need any specific tools installed on your own machine.

You'll install the GraalVM toolchain, generate a starter Spring Boot app using Spring Initializr, and build it as a native image application.

You'll then migrate a more complex application so that it can be deployed as a native image. This will give you the knowledge you need to migrate any Spring Boot application to be deployed as a native image.
