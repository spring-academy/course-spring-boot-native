Congrats! In this Lab, you completed a hands-on learning journey:

- You built an entire Spring Boot web application.
- You ran it as a JVM application.
- You ran it as a native image application, using two different build mechanisms:
  - As a native image, which is suitable while doing active development.
  - Using Cloud Native Buildpacks, which is suitable for deployment in the Cloud.
- You also learned about three tradeoffs you should consider when deciding which mode (JVM or native image) is more suitable for different situations:
  - Compilation time
  - Startup time
  - Memory usage
